# This project is focused on recognizing sign language alphabets using computer vision techniques. It uses a machine learning model to detect hand gestures and predict the corresponding alphabet in real-time using webcam input.

## Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for development.
MediaPipe: For detecting and processing hand landmarks.
OpenCV: For capturing video feed from the webcam and displaying the results.
Scikit-Learn: For training the machine learning model.
Pickle: For saving and loading the trained model.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
